CytoRSuite is designed to provide an interactive interface for the analysis of flow cytometry data in R. You can see CytoRSuite in action at **link to final website**. Learn more in vignette("CytoRSuite") or articles tab.

# Installation

CytoRSuite is built on the existing flow cytometry infrastructure for R developed by the [RGLab](https://github.com/RGLab). To install CytoRSuite, users should first install the latest versions of [flowCore](https://github.com/RGLab/flowCore), [flowWorkspace](https://github.com/RGLab/flowWorkspace) and [openCyto](https://github.com/RGLab/openCyto) from Bioconductor and GitHUb.

## flowCore

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Bioconductor
install.packages("BiocManager")

# flowCore Bioconductor release version
BiocManager::install("flowCore")

# GitHub
install.packages("devtools")

# flowCore development version on GitHub
devtools::install_github("RGLab/flowCore", ref = "trunk")
```

## flowWorkspace

flowWorkspace requires additional C++ libraries to build from source using Rtools for windows users. Windows users should follow these [instructions](https://github.com/RGLab/flowWorkspace/blob/trunk/INSTALL) before proceeding.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# flowWorkspace Bioconductor release version
BiocManager::install("flowWorkspace")

# flowWorkspace development version on GitHub
devtools::install_github("RGLab/flowWorkspace", ref = "trunk")
```

## openCyto

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# openCyto Bioconductor release version
BiocManager::install("openCyto")

# openCyto development version on GitHub
devtools::install_github("RGLab/openCyto", ref = "trunk")
```

## CytoRSuite

Once these packages are installed users can install **CytoRSuite** from GitHub. Users should also install CytoRSuiteData which contains example datasets that will be used in the vignettes to demonstrate the features of CytoRSuite.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# CytoRSuite development version on GitHub
devtools::install_github("DillonHammill/CytoRSuite")

# CytoRSuiteData development version on GitHub
devtools::install_github("DillonHammill/CytoRSuiteData")
```

* interactively modify spillover matrices using **spillover_edit**
* visualise compensation in all channels using **cyto_plot_compensation**
* easliy associate experimental details with each file using **cyto_annotate**
* manual gate drawing using **gate_draw**
* ability to edit drawn gates using **gate_edit**
* remove gates using **gate_remove**
* gate saving directly to an openCyto **gatingTemplate** for future use
* support for using both manual and automated gating approaches through linking to **openCyto**
* visualisation of flowFrames, flowSets, GatingHierarchies and GatingSets using **cyto_plot**
* visualisation of complete gating strategies with back-gating and/or gate tracking using **cyto_plot_gating_scheme**
* visualisation of marker expression in all channels using **cyto_plot_profile**
* export population level statistics using **cyto_stats_compute**

# Usage

The full details of how CytoRSuite works will be tackled individually in the package vignettes, but a succinct usage outline is described below:

1. Compensation of fluorecent spillover
  
    1.1 Load compensation controls into a `ncdfFlowSet`
        
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(CytoRSuite)
    library(CytoRSuiteData)
  
    # Save .fcs files to folder "Compensation Controls" in working directory
    files <- list.files(path = "Compensation Controls", full.names = TRUE)
    fs <- read.ncdfFlowSet(files = files)
    ```
    
    1.2 Load compensation controls into `GatingSet` for gating
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Gate Cells
    gate_draw(gs, 
              parent = "root",
              alias = "Cells",
              channels = c("FSC-A","SSC-A"),
              type = "polygon",
              gatingTemplate = "Compensation-gatingTemplate.csv")
    
    # Gate Single Cells
        gate_draw(gs, 
              parent = "Cells",
              alias = "Single Cells",
              channels = c("FSC-A","FSC-H"),
              type = "polygon",
              gatingTemplate = "Compensation-gatingTemplate.csv")
    ```
    
    ```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    library(CytoRSuite)
    library(CytoRSuiteData)
    
    gs <- GatingSet(Compensation)
    gating(Compensation_gatingTemplate, gs)
    
    par(mfrow = c(1,2))
    cyto_plot(gs, parent = "root", alias = "Cells", channels = c("FSC-A","SSC-A"), group_by = "all", layout = FALSE)
    cyto_plot(gs, parent = "Cells", alias = "Single Cells", channels = c("FSC-A","FSC-H"), group_by = "all", layout = FALSE)
    par(mfrow = c(1,1))
    ```
    
    1.3 Compute fluorescent spillover matrix using `spillover_compute`
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    spillover_compute(gs, 
                      parent = "Single Cells")
    ```
  
    1.4 Interactively edit computed spillover matrix using `spillover_edit`
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    spillover_edit(gs, 
                   parent = "Single Cells", 
                   channel_match = "Compensation-Channels.csv", 
                   spillover = "Spillover-Matrix.csv")
    ```
    
    ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', out.height='100%',fig.align="center"}
    knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/README-spillover_edit.PNG')
    ```
    
2. Analyse samples

    2.1 Load samples into a `ncdfFlowSet`
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Save samples to folder "Samples" in working directory
    files <- list.files(path = "Samples", full.names = TRUE)
    fs <- read.ncdfFlowSet(files = files)
    ```

    2.2 Annotate samples with markers using `cyto_markers`
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    cyto_markers(fs)
    ```
    
    ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='40%', out.height='40%',fig.align="center"}
    knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/README-cyto_markers.PNG')
    ```
    
    2.3 Annotate samples with experimental details using `cyto_annotate`

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    cyto_annotate(fs)
    ```

    ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='30%', out.height='30%',fig.align="center"}
    knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/README-cyto_annotate.PNG')
    ```

    2.4 Add samples to GatingSet
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    gs <- GatingSet(fs)
    ```

    2.4 Apply fluorescent compensation
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Load in spillover matrix
    spill <- read.csv("Spillover-Matrix.csv", 
                      header = TRUE, 
                      row.names = 1)
    colnames(spill) <- rownames(spill)
    
    # Apply compensation to samples
    gs <- compensate(gs, spill)
    ```

    2.5 Transform fluorescent channels for gating
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Fluorescent channels
    chans <- cyto_fluor_channels(gs)
    
    # Logicle transformation
    trans <- estimateLogicle(gs[[4]], chans)
    gs <- transform(gs, trans)
    ```
    
    2.6 Build gating scheme using `gate_draw`
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Cells
    gate_draw(gs,
              parent = "Cells",
              alias = "Cells",
              channels = c("FSC-A","SSC-A"),
              gatingTemplate = "Example-gatingTemplate.csv")
    
    # Copy above & edit to add new population(s)
    # Repeat until gating scheme is complete
    ```
    
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', out.height='60%',fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/README-gate_draw.gif')
```
    
3. Visualise gating schemes using `cyto_plot_gating_scheme`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cyto_plot_gating_scheme(gs[[4]], back_gate = TRUE)
```
  
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', out.height='100%',fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/README-cyto_plot_gating_scheme.png')
```
  
4. Export population-level statistics using `cyto_stats_compute`

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(CytoRSuite)
library(CytoRSuiteData)

fs <- Activation

fluor <- cyto_fluor_channels(fs)
chnls <- c("Alexa Fluor 405-A","Alexa Fluor 430-A","APC-Cy7-A", "PE-A", "Alexa Fluor 488-A", "Alexa Fluor 700-A", "Alexa Fluor 647-A", "7-AAD-A") 
markers <- c("Hoechst-405", "Hoechst-430", "CD11c", "Va2", "CD8", "CD4", "CD44", "CD69")
names(markers) <- chnls
markernames(fs) <- markers

pData(fs)$OVAConc <- c(0,0.005,0.05,0.5)

gs <- GatingSet(fs)
gs <- compensate(gs, fs[[1]]@description$SPILL)

trans <- estimateLogicle(gs[[4]], cyto_fluor_channels(gs))
gs <- transform(gs, trans)

gt <- gatingTemplate(system.file("extdata", "Activation-gatingTemplate.csv", package = "CytoRSuiteData"))
gating(gt,gs)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cyto_stats_compute(gs,
                   alias = c("CD4 T Cells","CD8 T Cells"),
                   channels = c("CD44","CD69"),
                   stat = "median")
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
cyto_stats_compute(gs,
                   alias = c("CD4 T Cells","CD8 T Cells"),
                   channels = c("CD44","CD69"),
                   stat = "median",
                   save = FALSE)
```

# News

There is a ChangeLog for the GitHub master branch which will reflect any updates made to improve the stability, usability or plenitude of the package.

# Credits

CytoRSuite would not be possible without the existing flow cytometry infrastructure developed by the RGLab. CytoRSuite started out as simple plugin for openCyto to facilitate gate drawing but has evolved into a fully-fledged flow cytometry analysis package thanks to the support and guidance of members of the RGLab. Please take the time to check out their work on [GitHub](https://github.com/RGLab).

# Development

CytoRSuite is a maturing package which will continue to be sculpted by the feedback of users. The GitHub \code{master} branch will always contain the most stable build of the package. New features and updates will be made to a separate branch and merged to the `master` branch when stable and tested. The changelog will reflect any changes made to the `master` branch and it is recommended that users visit this prior to installing newer versions of the package. Feature requests are welcome.

# Getting help

The Get started and Articles tabs on the CytoRSuite website are your first port of call if you require any help. For problems with the functioning of the package refer to the package issues to see if another user has experienced/rectified the issue you are experiencing. Otherwise feel free to post a new issue on the GitHub page so any potential issues can be rectified.
