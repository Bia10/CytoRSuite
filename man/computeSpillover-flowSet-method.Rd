}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class \code{flowSet} containing pre-gated compensation single stain controls as well as an unstained control.}

\item{trans}{object of class \code{"transformList"} generated by \code{estimateLogicle} to transform fluorescent channels for gating.}

\item{pdfile}{\code{pData} csv file containing additional column \code{"channel"} indicating the fluorescent channel associated
with each sample. This channel should be set to \code{"Unstained"} for unstained controls.}

\item{spfile}{name of the output spillover csv file, set to \code{"Spillover Matrix.csv"} by default.}
}
\value{
